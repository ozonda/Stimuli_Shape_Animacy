# Stimuli_Shape_Animacy
Stimulus set containing images of animals and visually-matched inanimate objects. 

These stimuli were used in the following papers:

Disentangling Representations of Object Shape and Object Category in Human Visual Cortex: The Animateâ€“Inanimate Distinction

MEG sensor patterns reflect perceptual but not categorical similarity of animate and inanimate objects

The Original stimulus set contains images of eight animals and eight inanimate objects divided into four shape-defined subsets. In each subset, there are two animals and two inanimate objects that share a similar shape. Additionally, there are four images of each individual animal/object, resulting in 64 stimuli in total.

The Outline folder contains the line drawing versions of the original stimuli.

The Texture folder contains images of texture patches taken from the center of each stimulus.
